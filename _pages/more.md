## 🗣️ Languages

Because my parents are from different cultures, and because I spent large part of my childhood in India even though I was born in America, learning languages has been central to my personal life. 

In addition to my first language of English, I am fluent in Hindi, Telugu, and Bengali. I also learnt Spanish in high school and continue to practice it, and am now moving on to learning Korean.

## 🎵 Music

I have been playing the violin for 14 years, specifically Hindustani classical music for 14 years and Western classical music for 7 years. I was part of an orchestra for 4 years, and have performed in Spain, India, and the USA. Recently however, my performances take place in my room and consist almost exclusively of anime OSTs. 

I have also been creating a playlist for my favorite genre citypop, attached below.
