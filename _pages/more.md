## Music

I have been playing the violin for 14 years, specifically Hindustani classical music for 14 years and Western classical music for 7 years. I was part of an orchestra for 4 years, and have performed in Spain, India, and the USA. Recently however, my performances take place in my room and consist almost exclusively of anime OSTs. 

In addition, I like to sing and compose, and I have also been creating a playlist, attached below, for my favorite genre citypop.
