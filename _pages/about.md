**About me:**

I am a 3rd year Undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego, majoring in Bioinformatics and minoring in Data Science.

My interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, biology, and data science. More specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms and pipelines utilizing machine learning and bioinformatics, for advancements in the understanding of disease and in improving healthcare.

I hope to pursue an M.S. in Data Science after I graduate.
