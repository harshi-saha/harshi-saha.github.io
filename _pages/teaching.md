All experiences listed below are for courses offered at the Harvard T.H. 
Chan School of Public Health of Harvard University, under employment by the 
[Biostatistics Department](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/).

I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with instructor [Georg Hahn](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/georg-hahn/)
and professor [Christoph Lange](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/christoph-lange/) as part of these courses.

**BST 262 - Computing for Big Data:** 
[[Fall 2 2025]](https://beta.my.harvard.edu/course/BST262/2025-Fall/1)

**Course Description:** [[link]](https://beta.my.harvard.edu/course/BST262/2025-Fall/1)

This course will give a critical presentation of software implementations, theoretical/algorithmic software development, and modern software tools to collect, store, and process data at scale. This will include hands-on programming practice, R package development (with C++ integration), software design and good software development practice, multiprocessing with OpenMP, cloud computing on the Harvard computing cluster, container images (Docker), and an introduction to big data stacks. The course includes data manipulation, state of the art workflows for software design and dissemination, software tool selection, and maintenance. It explores how big data influences several aspects of data science (for instance, software development and data management) and how modern tools can be leveraged to work with data efficiently.

All experiences listed below are for courses offered at the University
of California San Diego.
The data science courses [DSC] are under employment by the [Halıcıoğlu
Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), and the cognitive science 
course [COGS] is under employment by the [Cognitive Science Department](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/).

I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with lecturers [Janine Tiefenbruck](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/janine-tiefenbruck/),
[Suraj Rampure](https://rampure.org/), and [Kyle Shannon](https://www.kmshannon.com/about/) as part of these courses.

**DSC 80 - The Practice and Application of Data Science:** 
[[Winter 2024]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc80-2024-wi/)

**Course Description:** [[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc80)

This course bridges lower and upper-division data science courses 
as well as methods in other fields. Students master the data science 
life-cycle and learn many of the fundamental principles and 
techniques of data science spanning algorithms, statistics, machine 
learning, visualization, and data systems.

**DSC 40A - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I:** 
[[Spring 2024]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2024-sp/),
[[Spring 2023]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2023-sp/)

**Course Description:** [[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc40a)

This course introduces fundamental topics in machine learning,
statistics, and linear algebra with applications to data analysis. 
Students will become familiar with mathematical language for
expressing data analysis problems and solution strategies, and will 
receive training in probabilistic reasoning, mathematical modeling 
of data, and algorithmic problem solving.

**DSC 10 - Principles of Data Science:** 
[[Fall 2023]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2023-fa/),
[[Winter 2023]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2023-wi/),
[[Fall 2022]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2022-fa/)

**Course Description:** [[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc10)

This introductory course develops computational thinking and tools
necessary to answer questions that arise from large-scale datasets.
This course emphasizes an end-to-end approach to data science,
introducing programming techniques in Python that cover data
processing, modeling, and analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**COGS 9 - Introduction to Data Science:** 
[[Spring 2024]](https://kshannon-ucsd.github.io/cogs9/)

**Course Description:** [[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/COGS.html#cogs9)

This course introduces key concepts in data science, exploring
techniques such as data mining, text mining, machine learning, and
graph theory. Students focus on methods applied by scientists and
companies to investigate human cognition, providing a
foundation for understanding the intersection of data and cognitive
research.
