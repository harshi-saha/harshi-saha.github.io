All experiences listed below are for courses offered at the Harvard T.H. 
Chan School of Public Health of Harvard University, under employment by the 
[Biostatistics Department](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/).

I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with instructor [Georg Hahn](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/georg-hahn/)
and professor [Christoph Lange](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/christoph-lange/) as part of these courses.

**DSC 80 - The Practice and Application of Data Science:** 
[[Winter 2024]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc80-2024-wi/)

**Course Description** [[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc80)**:**

This course bridges lower and upper-division data science courses 
as well as methods in other fields. Students master the data science 
life-cycle and learn many of the fundamental principles and 
techniques of data science spanning algorithms, statistics, machine 
learning, visualization, and data systems.

**DSC 40A - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I:** 
[[Spring 2024]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2024-sp/),
[[Spring 2023]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2023-sp/)

**Course Description**
[[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc40a)**:**

This course introduces fundamental topics in machine learning,
statistics, and linear algebra with applications to data analysis. 
Students will become familiar with mathematical language for
expressing data analysis problems and solution strategies, and will 
receive training in probabilistic reasoning, mathematical modeling 
of data, and algorithmic problem solving.

**COGS 9 - Introduction to Data Science:** 
[[Spring 2024]](https://kshannon-ucsd.github.io/cogs9/)

**Course Description** 
[[link]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/COGS.html#cogs9)**:**

This course introduces key concepts in data science, exploring
techniques such as data mining, text mining, machine learning, and
graph theory. Students focus on methods applied by scientists and
companies to investigate human cognition, providing a
foundation for understanding the intersection of data and cognitive
research.
