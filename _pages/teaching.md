**DSC 40A - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I:**

- Quarters: 
  -  Spring 2023 [\[link\]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc40a-2023-sp/)
  
- Course Description [\[link\]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc40a):
  This course, the first of a two-course sequence (DSC 40A-B), will introduce the 
  theoretical foundations of data science. 
  
  Students will become familiar with mathematical language for expressing data analysis 
  problems and solution strategies, and will receive training in probabilistic reasoning, 
  mathematical modeling of data, and algorithmic problem solving. 
  
  DSC 40A will introduce fundamental topics in machine learning, statistics, and 
  linear algebra with applications to data analysis. 
 
**DSC 10 - Principles of Data Science:**

- Quarters: 
  -  Winter 2023 [\[link\]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2023-wi/)
  -  Fall 2022 [\[link\]](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2022-fa/)
  
- Course Description [\[link\]](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/DSC.html#dsc10):
  This introductory course develops computational thinking and tools necessary 
  to answer questions that arise from large-scale datasets. 
  
  This course emphasizes an end-to-end approach to data science, 
  introducing programming techniques in Python that cover data processing, 
  modeling, and analysis.
